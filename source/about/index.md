I started brewing in 2012.  Like a lot of others, my wife had bought me a Mr. Beer kit.  After doing a couple of kits, I was hooked.  From then on it was a series of growing and learning throughout the years.

Fullstack Brewing only recently got its name.  Coming from my career as a fullstack devloper, it made sense.  Someone who took on all aspects of a project from the front to back.
